      <p class="content1">
        The website will be a small business website that I currently own and operate.  
        The name of the website is “Buko Chong”. We supply young coconut juice to canteens 
        and restaurants here in the Philippines. Through that, we give additional income opportunities
        to our resellers. This website will be created in order to add legitimacy to the company, and to inform our customers to 
        possible changes and more opportunities.<br>
        <br>THE HOOK: For the homepage, we will focus on the products that we offer as a company. Every visitor in the site must learn that
        we offer income opportunities for them and introduce the lead product that we offer, the Buko Juice. 
        This page will be the hook of the product, it must give the customers additional excitement for this new opportunity.
        We will provide the information about how we come up with this business, our marketing strategy and how much will be the return of their hardwork and investment.<br>
        <br>THE BUKO JUICE: Buko Chong is 100% young coconut juice fresh from the tree to table. Packed with natural electrolytes to level up and boost energy. Great alternative for refreshments and drinks. No added sugar, preservatives or water. 100% real coconut juice.
        <br>THE RETURN: Every reseller has 20% return at 0% risk. That is because we only charge what they sell. And pull-out the ending inventory which will be then delivered to our other consignee. The product rotates and so the income flows. Through first in first out method the product remains fresh 
        <br>THE QUOTA: Every reseller must sell at least 1 box every day which amounts to PHP320, that will be their minimum quota. Failure to reach the quota will be subject to termination of consign contract. With a very minimal quota selling this product remains risk free, stress free and positive income generating.<br>
        <br>To sum up, every person that will visit the site must learn about what we sell, gain excitement to earn additional income, understand the terms and minimal conditions that we offer. 
        Again, this website is only to provide information and data and not for business transactions. All transactions will be a separate contact information found in "Reach us" page.
